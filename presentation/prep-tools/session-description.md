# Jfokus 2026 - Lab Session

**Duration:** 3.5 hours (hands-on lab)

## Session Description

AI is moving out from the digital world into the physical world. In this hands-on lab, you'll get to explore how large language models (LLMs), multimodal AI, and edge intelligence can control real IoT devices and robotic systems. Together, we'll connect a robotic arm ("Candytron 4000"), cameras, microphones, and other sensors into an interactive setup where AI doesn't just chat—it sees, listens, and acts. There will be candy handed out in this session!

## Key Components

- **LLMs** - Large Language Models with function calling/tool use
- **Multimodal AI** - Vision, speech, and action
- **Edge Intelligence** - Running AI on edge devices
- **Candytron 4000** - Robotic arm setup
- **Sensors** - Cameras, microphones, and other inputs

## Hardware Setup

### 1. Candytron 4000 (Niryo Ned 2)
- 6-axis collaborative robotic arm
- Gripper for candy manipulation
- External camera (candy detection / computer vision)
- Microphone (speech input)
- Speaker (TTS output)
- Table with assorted candy
- **Status: Code complete and working**

### 2. Reachy Mini (Pollen Robotics)
- Small humanoid robot
- Expressive head/face
- Dual arms with grippers

### 3. IKEA IoT Devices
- Smart home devices (lights, sensors, etc.)
- DIRIGERA hub / Zigbee-based
- Participants can control real home automation

## Software Components

- LLM with function calling (brain)
- Computer Vision / YOLO (eyes)
- Speech pipeline (ears/mouth)
- Robot control interface
