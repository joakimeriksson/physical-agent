# Disable specific warnings that are intentional design choices:
# C0415: import-outside-toplevel - Intentional lazy loading for slow imports
# W0603: global-statement - Intentional caching pattern
# C0103: invalid-name - Private cached variables like _whisper_model
# R0801: duplicate-code - Similar patterns across labs (educational)
